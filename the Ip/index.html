        <h1>Akan name generator</h1>
        <p>Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 
           'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.<br>This website does the above
            by utilising your birthday data,</p>
