            <p >Akan names are derived from Ghanian culture. Frequently in Ghana, children are given their first name as a 
                'day name' which corresponds to the day in the week they were born.<br>This website does the above
                 by utilising your birthday data,</p>

                    <p>Depending on the region (and whether it is Christian or Muslim) the children will 
                        often get common Christian or Muslim first names.

                        With it, at least the first names are complete. The names are given in the
                        following order:
                        <ui>
                        <li>Religious name (either Christian or Muslim)</li>
                        <li>Number (Frist/ Second/... born)</li>
                        <li>Day of the week</li>
                        <li>Twin information</li>
                        <li>Situation Information</li>
                        <li>Surname</li>
                        </ui>
                        
                        With this knowledge it is easy to find out your personal Ghanaian name. If you use 
                        the overview above as your orientation, you can (except for the situation 
                        information) compile your personal Ghanaian name very precisely.</p>
